## New in v0.6.10

- Enhanced Auto-Gain Functionality: Automatic gain calculation logic based on processing order (EQ/Convolver standalone, Conv→EQ, EQ→Conv) was added, along with heuristic-based Q-surge margins and safety margin calculations. A new `AutoGainPlanner` class was introduced to design the input/output gain auto-adjustment algorithm as a purely functional planner, improving clamping ranges and net 0dB alignment.
- Added Deferred Deletion Queue Reclaim Test: A dedicated 745-line test suite was added to verify the behavior of `DeferredDeletionQueue::reclaim()`. This suite comprehensively validates RCU mechanism safety, covering epoch progression, FIFO order guarantees, concurrent enqueue/reclaim operations, MPMC epoch correctness, and state invariants during reclamation.
- Improved ISR Runtime Governance: Enhancements were made to the ISR (Intelligent State Reconstruction) publication adjuster, retirement router, and runtime builder. Capabilities for state transition monitoring, publication behavior verification, and graph consistency checks were expanded; additionally, bug fixes for `RuntimeWorldAuthorityProjection` and fade state management using `fadingRuntimeUuid` were implemented.
- Enhanced Thread Affinity Management: The `ThreadAffinityManager` improved CPU affinity mask management for audio threads, adding support for the `AudioRealtime` thread type and dedicated mask settings introduced in "Work 64." Thread priority management on Windows was improved through MMCSS priority application capabilities and the `tryApplyMmcssForSelfManagedThread()` method.
- Eliminated Real-Time Blockers in Audio Threads: Non-real-time operations within audio threads (such as `Logger::writeToLog()`, `std::hash`, and the `GetCurrentProcessorNumber()` syscall) were eliminated or conditionally compiled out. Issues involving CRT function calls and false sharing were resolved; furthermore, interrupt-free processing for real-time threads was ensured by making `ScopedNoDenormals` thread-local and enhancing the safety of atomic operations.
ConvoPeq is a high-fidelity standalone audio processor for Windows 11 x64, combining IR convolution and a 20-band parametric EQ with a real-time analyzer.

## Audio Processing Method

This section is a user-facing summary of the current block processing strategy. For in-depth, code-referenced technical documentation (DSP stages, mathematical formulas, SIMD/real-time safety, code path examples), see `SOUND_PROCESSING.md`. For subsystem-level architectural details, threading model, RCU patterns, and ISR governance, see `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### 1) Quality-Oriented Design Principles

ConvoPeq is designed to preserve fidelity under real-time conditions.

- **64-bit double-precision DSP** throughout the main processing path — reduces cumulative rounding error across cascaded stages.
- **All heavy preparation is moved off the audio thread**: filter coefficient computation (`std::sin`/`std::cos`), IR loading/resampling, noise shaper coefficient learning (CMA-ES), and state validation occur on message/worker threads.
- **SIMD (AVX2/FMA) + Intel oneMKL acceleration** are used where throughput matters: `scaleBlockFallback`, `softClipBlockAVX2`, FIR convolution in oversampling stages, MKL DFTI for IR convolution, VSL RNG for dither generation.
- **Transition-safe state changes**: all parameter handoff uses atomic publish/consume or RCU (Read-Copy-Update) with `EpochDomain` — no clicks, zipper noise, or abrupt latency jumps.

### 2) Block Entry and State Snapshot

For each callback block, `AudioEngine::processBlockDouble()` enters the audio thread with:

```cpp
AudioCallbackRuntimeScope (lifecycleToken + firewallToken)
ScopedNoDenormals              // flush denormals to zero
ThreadRole::AudioRealtime      // numeric policy verification
```

The `ProcessingState` snapshot is assembled from atomic reads and RCU-published shared state at block start. The entire block is then processed using only this **read-only, consistent snapshot** — no blocking operations, no parameter races, no allocation.

### 3) Main DSP Chain

Typical logical flow (exact sequence from `SOUND_PROCESSING.md`):

```
Input → Headroom Gain → DC Block → Oversampling (optional) →
[EQ ↔ Convolver] (order selectable, or Mixed parallel) →
OutputFilter (HCF/LCF or HPF/LPF conditional) →
Soft Clip (musical, fastTanh, AVX2) → Makeup Gain →
Dither/Noise Shaping → Downsampling (if OS) → Output
```

- **Order is runtime-selectable**: EQ→Convolver, Convolver→EQ, or **Mixed** (parallel processing, blended by α mix ratio).
- Oversampling factor: 1×/2×/4×/8× (IIRLike or LinearPhase preset).
- Input headroom gain and output makeup gain are AVX2-optimized, gain values pre-converted to linear in the message thread (no `std::pow` on audio thread).
- Convolver input trim is applied only when processing order is **EQ→Convolver** and both processors are active.

### 4) Convolution Strategy

`ConvolverProcessor` (split TU, 10 files in `src/convolver/`) uses asynchronous IR preparation and RCU-based safe handoff:

- **IR load/rebuild** is handled by a dedicated `LoaderThread` (`std::thread`) — audio thread never blocks on file I/O or IR resampling.
- **Rebuild requests are debounced** (`REBUILD_DEBOUNCE_DEFAULT_MS`) to reduce burst load from rapid parameter changes.
- **RCU handoff**: new IR state atomically swapped; audio thread continues with old IR without interruption. Old engines retired via `ISRRetireRouter` → `DeletionQueue`.
- **Latency retargeting** is hysteresis-controlled to avoid frequent retriggers.
- User-facing controls are debounced to avoid unnecessary rebuild pressure during UI dragging.

Convolution algorithm: **Intel MKL NUC (Non-Uniform Partitioned Convolution)** with non-uniform block partitioning (shorter blocks near IR start for low latency, longer blocks toward the tail for efficiency).

Phase modes: **As-Is / Minimum / Mixed**. Mixed mode blends linear-phase (low frequencies) with minimum-phase (high frequencies) per `mixedTransitionStartHz` / `mixedTransitionEndHz` / `tau`.

### 5) EQ Strategy

`EQProcessor` (split TU, 6 files in `src/eqprocessor/`) applies per-band parametric filtering in real time:

- **20-band TPT (Topology-Preserving Transform) SVF** based on Vadim Zavalishin's "The Art of VA Filter Design" — smooth parameter modulation, low noise.
- **RCU-based coefficient handoff**: UI/worker thread creates new `EQState` / `BandNode`, publishes via `publishAtomic(currentStateBits, ...)`. Audio thread loads via `loadCurrentState(acquire)`.
- **EQCoeffCache**: refcounted shared coefficient cache — multiple snapshots share coefficients when parameters are identical.
- **Nonlinear saturation**: `fastTanh` rational polynomial approximation applied per-sample within the SVF loop (no `libm`, branchless for |x| < CLIP_THRESHOLD).
- **AGC** (Auto Gain Control): envelope-tracking automatic gain adjustment with precomputed attack/release/smooth coefficient lookup tables.
- **M/S (Mid-Side) processing**: supports per-band Left/Right/Mid/Side channel modes via `kFilterChannels=4`.

### 6) Oversampling, Output Conditioning, and Finalization

Additional quality-oriented stages applied around the core EQ/convolution chain:

- **Input oversampling** (`CustomInputOversampler`): 2×/4×/8× via multi-stage Kaiser-windowed FIR interpolation, AVX2/FMA SIMD, denormal flush. DC blocker applied after upsampling.
- **Output filtering** (`OutputFilter`): conditional on final processor — HCF+LCF when convolver is last (4th-order Butterworth/LR, 18–22 kHz), or HPF+LPF when EQ is last (Butterworth 2nd, 19–24 kHz). All coefficients precomputed in message thread; audio thread performs only biquad SOS evaluation (no `libm`).
- **Soft clipping** (`softClipBlockAVX2`): piecewise musical clip (linear → knee `t²(3−2t)` → `fastTanh` saturation), AVX2 vectorized (4 doubles/IP), `prevSampleInOut` scalar feedback across blocks. Anti-inter-sample-peak protection via smooth knee transition.
- **Dither/noise shaping**: 4 types (Psychoacoustic 12th-order / Fixed 4th-order / Fixed 15th-order / Adaptive 9th-order with CMA-ES). All TPDF dither, 64-byte aligned, lock-free audio thread path. RNG ring buffer pre-filled, worker thread refills.

### 7) Analyzer Path

Analyzer data is decoupled from output audio:

- Audio thread pushes analyzer source data to `LockFreeRingBuffer` (SPSC, 64-byte aligned, atomic head/tail).
- UI timer reads FIFO and runs FFT visualization (`SpectrumAnalyzerComponent`).
- Analyzer update rate is adaptive by state (active/disabled/hidden) to limit UI-thread load.

This separation ensures visualization quality does not compromise audio-thread safety.

### 8) Latency Reporting

Latency display uses a unified breakdown model from `AudioEngine::getCurrentLatencyBreakdown()`:

- **Oversampling latency**: base-rate estimated from FIR tap counts per stage (IIRLike: 511/127/31, LinearPhase: 1023/255/63).
- **Convolver algorithm latency** + **IR peak latency**: reported from `ConvolverProcessor::getLatencyBreakdown()`.
- **SoftClip local OS latency**: 15 base-rate samples (31-tap Halfband, 2 passes).
- All values reported in both `ms` and `samples` from `totalLatencyBaseRateSamples`.

### 9) State Persistence

Two persistence paths:

- **Auto-save** (`device_settings.xml`): device state + compact runtime settings (dither bit depth, oversampling factor/type, input headroom, output makeup).
- **Manual preset XML** (Save/Load Preset): full `AudioEngine` + `EQ` + `Convolver` state including phase/mixed parameters, Auto/Manual IR-length state.

### 10) Real-Time Safety Rules

The audio callback path avoids:

- file I/O, blocking locks/waits,
- heavy runtime allocations (`malloc`/`new`/`resize`),
- `libm` calls (`std::sin`/`std::cos`/`std::pow`/`std::log`/`std::exp`),
- exceptions, UI thread interactions,
- `std::condition_variable` waits.

Buffers and heavy state are prepared outside the callback (`prepareToPlay()`). Old resources are garbage collected asynchronously (`DeferredDeletionQueue`, `RefCountedDeferred`, `DeferredFreeThread`).

In practice, ConvoPeq aims for both:

- **high sound quality**: double-precision DSP, long-form convolution (MKL NUC), oversampling, TPT SVF EQ, psychoacoustic noise shaping, ITU-R BS.1770 metering, and
- **stable real-time behavior**: asynchronous preparation, debounce, RCU state handoff, ISR runtime governance, and callback-safe processing boundaries.

## Project Scope

- Standalone desktop application
- Windows-only runtime target
- Real-time audio processing with separate UI/analyzer pipeline

## Build Requirements

1. **Visual Studio 2022 (17.x) or 2026 (18.x)** with *Desktop development with C++* workload
   - Alternatively: **Intel icx** compiler (oneAPI 2026.0) — no VS required for icx mode
2. **CMake 3.22+**
3. **Ninja** (build system, used via `Ninja Multi-Config` generator)
4. **Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit** (MKL) — required for both MSVC and icx
5. Local `JUCE/` directory (JUCE 8.0.12 expected, containing `JUCE/CMakeLists.txt`)

For full instructions including PGO, icx compiler flags, CTest suite, ASan, and troubleshooting, see `BUILD_GUIDE_WINDOWS.md`.

---

## Quick Build

**Recommended**: use `build.bat` from the repository root:

```cmd
build.bat Release              # MSVC Release (default)
build.bat Debug                # MSVC Debug
build.bat Release icx          # Intel icx Release
build.bat Debug   icx          # Intel icx Debug
build.bat Release clean        # Clean + build
build.bat Release pgo-gen      # MSVC PGO instrumentation
build.bat Release pgo-use     # MSVC PGO optimization
```

What `build.bat` does:

1. Auto-detects Visual Studio via `vswhere` (or falls back to known VS17/VS18 paths)
2. Calls `vcvarsall.bat x64` (MSVC mode) — skipped for icx
3. Calls Intel `setvars.bat intel64` (both MSVC and icx)
4. Configures CMake with `Ninja Multi-Config` generator
5. Builds selected configuration
6. Retries once on RC1109 (common icx first-build issue)

**Output binaries:**

| Compiler | Build Dir | Binary |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| MSVC Debug | `build/` | `build\ConvoPeq_artefacts\Debug\ConvoPeq.exe` |
| MSVC Release | `build/` | `build\ConvoPeq_artefacts\Release\ConvoPeq.exe` |
| icx Debug | `build-icx/` | `build-icx\ConvoPeq_artefacts\Debug\ConvoPeq.exe` |
| icx Release | `build-icx/` | `build-icx\ConvoPeq_artefacts\Release\ConvoPeq.exe` |

MSVC and icx use **completely separate build directories** — both can be kept simultaneously.

### Manual Build (MSVC Equivalent)

```cmd
call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\[2022|2026]\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" intel64
cmake -S . -B build -G "Ninja Multi-Config" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=cl -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=cl
cmake --build build --config Debug
```

For `CMakePresets.json` usage, VS Code task reference, CTest suite commands, and full icx configuration, see `BUILD_GUIDE_WINDOWS.md`.

## Notes

- Standalone app target (not a plugin target) — **Windows 11 x64 only**
- Default daily workflow: `build.bat` or VS Code tasks (22 tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json`)
- MSVC and icx build directories are fully isolated (`build/` vs `build-icx/`) — can coexist
- PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization) is MSVC-only; not supported for icx
- RNG ring buffer for dither is pre-filled by worker thread — no RNG generation on audio thread
- All coefficients (EQ SVF, filter biquad, AGC tables, noise shaper) precomputed in message thread
 - 21 CTest regression tests available (`cmake --build build --config Debug && cd build && ctest -C Debug`)
- Do not modify external dependency trees directly:
  - `JUCE/`
  - `r8brain-free-src/`
